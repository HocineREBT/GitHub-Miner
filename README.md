# GitHub-Miner
In this repository, we host the artefacts of our data collection pipeline GitHub-Miner for our study: **_Dependabot and Security Pull Requests: Large Empirical Study_**. This work has been submitted to the Empirical Software Engineering Journal, and is currently under review.

The pipeline allows to mine and collect pull request-related issues using the GitHub Search API. Then, extract data related to users, repositories, pull requests, and commits.
