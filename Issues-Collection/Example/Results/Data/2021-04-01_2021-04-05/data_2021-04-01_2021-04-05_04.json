The change was introduced recently in 1b784ff. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/1032\">#1032</a> for details.</p>\n<p>This creates two problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When test mode is on, the authenticity verification logic is run inappropriately against requests where this may not even be wanted.</li>\n<li>The behavior varies from actual production behavior, potentially allowing bugs to be introduced by unwary developers.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that this bug was only present when OmniAuth was configured for test_mode and using the mock_call phases.</p>\n<h2>Allow passing rack-protection configuration to default request_validation_phase</h2>\n<p>This release now properly allows an instance of OmniAuth::AuthenticityTokenProtection (with passed in rack-protection configuration) to be used as the request_validation_phase.</p>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jkowens\"><code>@jkowens</code></a> <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/1027\">#1027</a></p>\n<p>If you haven't already read the <a href=\"https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/releases/tag/v2.0.0\">release notes</a> for v2.0.0, you should do so.</p>\n<h2>v2.0.0</h2>\n<p>Version 2.0 of OmniAuth includes some changes that may be breaking depending on how you use OmniAuth in your app.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the folks who contributed in code and discussion for these changes.</p>\n<h2><strong>OmniAuth now defaults to only POST as the allowed request_phase method.</strong></h2>\n<p>Hopefully, you were already doing this as a result of the warnings due to <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9284\">CVE-2015-9284</a>.<br />\nFor detailed context, see:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/960\">#960</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809\">#809</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284\">Resolving CVE-2015-9284</a></p>\n<p>This change also includes an additional configurable phase: <code>request_validation_phase</code>.</p>\n<h3>Rack/Sinatra</h3>\n<p>By default, this uses rack-protection's <a href=\"https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master/rack-protection\">AuthenticityToken</a> class to validate authenticity tokens.

There is no check to confirm that the public key point passed into the derive function actually exists on the secp256k1 curve. This results in the potential for the private key used in this implementation to be revealed after a number of ECDH operations are performed.</p>\n<p>Affected versions: &lt; 6.5.4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh7m-p724-62c2\">The GitHub Security Advisory Database</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Signature Malleabillity in elliptic</strong>\nThe Elliptic package before version 6.5.3 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\\0' bytes, or integer overflows.
